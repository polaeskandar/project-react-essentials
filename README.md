# React Essentials using React.js

I created this project as my initial foray into frontend development with React.js. The entire application was developed solely using React.js, without incorporating any other frameworks. I successfully completed this project with the excellent guidance of instructor Maximillian Schwarzm√ºller, as part of my learning experience in this course.
